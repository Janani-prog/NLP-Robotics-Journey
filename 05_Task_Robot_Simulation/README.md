# Task 5: Task-Based Robot Simulation Scenarios

## Overview
This directory contains a collection of interactive HTML simulations, each representing a distinct robot-assisted disaster response scenario. The simulations are designed to visually demonstrate how robots can be deployed for various critical tasks in real-world disaster environments, such as medical camp setup, dam surveillance, firebreak creation, and more.

## Key Components

All scenario simulations are implemented as standalone HTML files in the `html simulations/` folder. Each file provides a unique, animated visualization of a specific disaster response operation:

- **001-Thermal Survival Search.html**: Simulates thermal imaging for survivor search.
- **002-Airdrop Survival Kit.html**: Visualizes aerial supply drops.
- **003-Chemical Leak Alert.html**: Shows chemical hazard detection and alerting.
- **004-Debris Clearing.html**: Demonstrates robotic debris removal.
- **005-Medical Camp Setup.html**: Simulates rapid medical camp deployment.
- **006-Lidar Structural Scan.html**: Visualizes structural integrity scanning using Lidar.
- **007-Drone Water Rescue.html**: Depicts drone-assisted water rescue.
- **008-Firebreak Parameter Creation.html**: Shows firebreak creation to contain wildfires.
- **009-LED Evacuation Beacon.html**: Simulates LED beacon deployment for evacuation guidance.
- **010-Emergency Mesh Netwwork.html**: Demonstrates emergency communication network setup.
- **011-Ammonia Neutralisation.html**: Visualizes chemical neutralization operations.
- **012-Power Restoration.html**: Simulates power grid restoration.
- **013-Survivor Facial Recognition.html**: Shows facial recognition for survivor identification.
- **014-Dam Surveillance.html**: Depicts aerial surveillance of dam breaches.
- **015-Water Purification.html**: Simulates water purification in disaster zones.

## How to Use

1. Open any `.html` file in the `html simulations/` folder with your web browser.
2. Interact with the scenario as described in the file (most are animated visualizations).

## Directory Structure

# 07_Commands_Simulation

This folder contains resources and simulations related to robotic operations command and control using NLP-driven disaster response scenarios.

## Contents

- **robotic_operations_command_center.html**: An interactive HTML simulation for managing robotic operations in disaster scenarios. It provides a command center interface for issuing and visualizing robotic commands.
- **nlp_disaster.json**: A dataset of disaster-related commands and scenarios, used for simulating and testing NLP-based robotic command interpretation.

## Usage

1. **Open `robotic_operations_command_center.html`** in your web browser to interact with the command center simulation.
2. **Review or modify `nlp_disaster.json`** to update or analyze the set of disaster response commands and scenarios.

## Purpose

This simulation demonstrates how natural language processing can be used to interpret and execute robotic commands in disaster response situations. It is intended for research, demonstration, and educational purposes within the broader NLP-Robotics-Journey project.

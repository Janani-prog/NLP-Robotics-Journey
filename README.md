# NLP Bilingual Disaster Response Visual Generation Project

## From Curiosity to Crisis Response: The Story of a Bilingual AI Journey

Welcome to a project where language, robotics, and human ingenuity converge to create a smarter, safer world. This repository is more than code‚Äîit's the chronicle of a summer internship, guided by Professor S. Sangeetha (NIT Trichy), that transformed raw data and bold ideas into a bilingual (English & Tamil) AI system for disaster response. Here, every folder is a chapter, and every simulation a step toward real-world impact.

## üöÄ The Journey: Chapter by Chapter

### **Chapter 1: Exploring the Unknown (01_Task_Dataset_Analysis)**
Every adventure begins with discovery. We started by delving into robotics and disaster response datasets, mapping their structure and potential for NLP. This foundational analysis revealed the opportunities and challenges that shaped our path.
- **Artifacts:** [Presentation, summary, and insights](01_Task_Dataset_Analysis/)

### **Chapter 2: Simulating the First Steps (02_Task_Simulations)**
Armed with knowledge, we built our first bridges between language and action. Using the KITTI dataset for navigation and the `milistu/robot-instructions` dataset for direct command execution, we showed that even simple NLP could drive robots in meaningful ways.
- **Artifacts:** [KITTI navigation and robot instruction simulations](02_Task_Simulations/)

### **Chapter 3: Giving Robots a Body (03_Task_Robot_Arm_Simulation)**
Next, we brought language to life‚Äîcontrolling a robot arm through code. This phase was about translating words into movement, and simulating the tactile reality of robotic response.
- **Artifacts:** [Robot arm simulation and control code](03_Task_Robot_Arm_Simulation/)

### **Chapter 4: Seeing the Bigger Picture (04_Task_Dataset_Simulation, 05_Task_Robot_Simulation & 06_Environment_Simulation)**
Disaster response is more than commands‚Äîit's about context, environment, and coordination. We created:
- **Visual disaster maps** to simulate crisis scenarios ([04_Task_Dataset_Simulation/](04_Task_Dataset_Simulation/))
- **HTML-based robot simulations** to visualize diverse robotic operations ([05_Task_Robot_Simulation/](05_Task_Robot_Simulation/))
- **Web-based environment simulators** for immersive, interactive disaster environments ([06_Environment_Simulation/](06_Environment_Simulation/))

### **Chapter 5: Commanding the Swarm (07_Commands_Simulation)**
Imagine orchestrating a fleet of robots with a single interface. Our command center simulation lets users issue natural language commands and see coordinated robotic actions unfold‚Äîa taste of real-world command and control.
- **Artifacts:** [Robotic Operations Command Center](07_Commands_Simulation/)

### **Chapter 6: The Language of Help‚ÄîNLP Disaster Response (08_NLP_Simulation & 09_Bilingual_Simulation)**
The summit of our journey: a full-stack, bilingual (English & Tamil) NLP system for disaster response. Here, operators issue commands in either language, and the system interprets, visualizes, and simulates the response on an interactive map. With robust intent recognition, entity extraction, and direct Tamil-English command mapping, the system is both practical and inclusive.
- **Artifacts:**
  - [English NLP Disaster Response Prototype](08_NLP_Simulation/)
  - [Aura: Bilingual AI Disaster Response System](09_Bilingual_Simulation/)
